# Script to build the ffmpeg audio extension

Running `./build-natives.sh` will download the Ndk (if missing), and build the native parts of the ffmpeg extension.

If you already have the Ndk installed you can pass it, `NDK_PATH=YOUR_PATH ./build-natives.sh`, and it will use the Ndk you provide in `YOUR_PATH`.
