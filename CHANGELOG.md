**1.0.6**
- Added option "Animations Disabled?" which is default "false" but when true it will work around the issue where the screen does not clear.  This is a temporary work around until I find a permanent solution.

**1.0.5**
- Animation updates (less flicker)
- Fixed crash on Android N
- Updated libaries (ExoPlayer, IJKPlayer, and LibGDX) to latest versions
